# Assignment Objectives
This assignment centered around using exisiting HTML and CSS skills and gaining further skills with jQuery to create a good looking and user-responsive web app. Minimally, the game needed to:
* Generate a random number to be matched
* Offer 4 user input options whose number value is randomized each game and hidden from view
* Write a running tally of points added by each click of the user's guess
* Display a success or failure message for exactly matching the target number
* Keep a tally of games won and games lost 

# Personal Challenges and Lessons
Prior to this challenge I worked a long time on a character battle game, and that project was dense and full of bugs to unravel. Due to my approach with that game, I was able to build this new Jewel game from scratch in a fraction of the time, and in the end only spent a handful of hours on it over 2 days to get to completion. The mistakes I had made with the larger game helped me begin this new game by getting all of my basic functionality and DOM feedback working before I tried any fancy styling or additional game features. I got good practice with:
* Building a rough shell in HTML with minimal CSS to prove my game worked properly
* Building a light function-based program and game flow logic in Javascript
* Easily grabbing and writing to HTML elements with jQuery
* Event handling and managing handlers without overlaps and unexpected inputs
* Creating fun graphics
* Using a light jQuery library for a float effect to make it more visually fun
